- **Does Python have OOp's concept ?**
> Python is an object oriented programming language. This means that any program can be solved in Python by creating a model. However, Python can be treated as procedural as well as structural language.

- **How to add values to Python array ?**
> Elements can be added to an array using the append(), extend(), and insert(i, x) function.

- **How do you do data abstraction in Python ?**
> Data abstraction is providing only the required details ad hiding the implementation from the world. It can achieved in Python by using interface and abstract class.

- **How will you capitalize the first letter of a string ?**
> In Python, the capitalize() method capitalizes the first letter of the strings. If the string already consists of a capital letter at the beginning, then it returns the original string.

- **What are generators in Python ?**
> Functions that return an iterable set of items are called generators.

- **What are docstrings in Python ?**
> Docstrings are not actually comments, but they are documentation strings : These docstrings are within triple quotes. They are not assigned to any variable and therefore at times serve the purpose of comments as well.

- **What are built-ins types of Python ?**
> Integers, floating-point, complex numbers, string, boolean, built-in function.

- **Define encapsulation in Python**
> Encapsulation means binding the code and data together. A Python class is an example of encapsulation.

- **What does an object() do ?**
> It returns a featureless object that is a base class for all classes. Also it does not take any parameter.

- **How to create empty class in Python ?**
> The empty class is a class that does not have any code defined within its block. It can be created using the pass keyword. However, you can create object of this class outside the class itself.In Python, the pass command does nothing when its executed, we call that a null statement.

- **Does Python support multiple inheritance ?**
> Multiple inheritance means that a class can be derived from more than one parent class. Python does support multiple inheritance unlike Java.

- **What is polymorphism in Python ?**
> Polymorphism means the ability to take multiple forms. If the parent class has a method named ABC then the child class also can have method with the same name ABC having its own parameter and variable. Python allows polymorphism.

- **How to import modules in Python ?**
> Modules can be imported using the import keyword. You can import modules in three ways :
	Import array
	Import array as arr
	From array import *

- **What is split used for ?**
> The split() method is used to separate a given string in Python.

- **What is pickling and unpickling ?**
> Pickle module accepts any Python object and convert it into string representation and dump it using dump function, this process is called pickling. While the process of retrieving original Python object from the stored string representation is called unpickling.
