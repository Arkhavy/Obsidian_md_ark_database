Python Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:
```Python
and   Returns True if both statements are true       x < 5 and x < 10
or    Returns True if one of the statements is true  x < 5 or x < 4
not   Returns False if the result is true            not(x < 5 and x < 10)
```
