Python Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Comparison operators are used to compare two values:
```Python
==   Equal                      x == y
!=   Not equal                  x != y
>    Greater than               x > y
<    Less than                  x < y
>=   Greater than or equal to   x >= y
<=   Less than or equal to      x <= y
```
