Python Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:
```Python
&    AND    Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
|    OR     Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
^    XOR    Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
~    NOT    Inverts all the bits

<<   Zero fill left shift     Shift left pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off

>>   Signed right shift       Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
```
