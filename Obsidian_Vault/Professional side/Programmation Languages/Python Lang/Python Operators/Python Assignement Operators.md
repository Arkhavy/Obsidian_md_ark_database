Python Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables :
```Python
=    x = 5      x = 5
+=   x += 3     x = x + 3
-=   x -= 3     x = x - 3
*=   x *= 3     x = x * 3
/=   x /= 3     x = x / 3
%=   x %= 3     x = x % 3
//=  x //= 3    x = x // 3
**=  x **= 3    x = x ** 3
&=   x &= 3     x = x & 3
|=   x |= 3     x = x | 3
^=   x ^= 3     x = x ^ 3
>>=  x >>= 3    x = x >> 3
<<=  x <<= 3    x = x << 3
```
