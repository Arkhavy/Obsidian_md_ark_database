#Python 

Python Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
```Python
print(10 + 5)
```

Python divides the operators in the following groups:
- [[Python Arithmetic Operators]]
- [[Python Assignement Operators]]
- [[Python Comparison Operators]]
- [[Python Logical operators]]
- [[Python Identity Operators]]
- [[Python Bitwise Operators]]
- [[Python Membership Operators]] ?
