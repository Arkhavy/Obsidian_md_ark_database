Python Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:
```Python
is       Returns True if both variables are the same object        x is y
is not   Returns True if both variables are not the same object    x is not y
```
