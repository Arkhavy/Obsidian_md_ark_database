You are feeling hungry. You have 2 ways to eat:
1. Cook and eat yourself
2. Order it from an online website

You decided to order food from an online food website.
The food order comapny has received your order and start preparing it.

While delivering food order company check labels and delivers it to your doorstep.
> Label
> Item : "Pizza"
> Quantity : "1"
> Type : "Non-veg"
> Extra topping : "yes"

PIP works in same way food website does but for Python projects.

What is PIP ?
PIP is the package installer for Python. You can use PIP to install packages from the Python Package index and other indexes.
Basically you tell it what package you want to install, and PIP downloads it and installs it, so that the package can be used in Python programs on your system.
