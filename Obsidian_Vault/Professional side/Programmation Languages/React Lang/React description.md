#React

To read with [[Angular description]]

1. React is a JavaScript library for UI development. It is managed by Facebook and an open-source commmunity of developers.

2. React is a framework for UI development, so apps written with React need additional libraries to be used.

3. React is minimalistic: no dependency injection, no classic templates, no overly complicated features. The framework will be quite simple to understand if you already know JavaScript well.

4. React's performance is greatly improved with the introduction of the virtual DOM. Since all virtual DOM trees are lightweight and built on server, the load on browser is reduced.

5. React is based of JavaScript ES6+ combined with JSX script. JSX is an extension for syntax, which makes a JavaScript code resemble that written in HTML.

6. React takes longer to set up. But, it is really fast for delivering projects and building apps.

7. React language uses one-way data binding.

8. React gives you the freedom to choose the tools, architecture and libraries for developing an app.
