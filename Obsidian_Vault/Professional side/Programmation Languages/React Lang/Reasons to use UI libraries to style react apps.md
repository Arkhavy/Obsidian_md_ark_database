#React

- **Rapid development process**
> Nothing personal against using CSS but time is your most important asset and you don't want to waste it designing the most beautiful app in the world when you're not even sure how many people will use it. There are lots of amazing libraries from Material UI, Semantic UI, Chakra UI to React Bootstrap, etc.

- **Awesome UI**
> Building faster is no excuse for building ugly websites. Your website even in its very first version should have a decent level of aestheticism in it otherwise your customer would hate the design and wouldn't come back later.

- **No coding from scratch**
> Pre-build UI components help you code less but create faster. Developers are also humans and therefore have finite energy with them, so it's always good to use that energy on the most important task which is writing the code that makes your app functional.

- **More time for development**
> It's a no-brainer. Cutting down the time on styling will automatically give you more time for development.

- **Easy to work with**
> If you don't have a knack for CSS, sometimes it can be boring and hard to build various complex layouts and beautiful designs.

- **No CSS maintenance**
> This is a great sigh of relief for developers considering how hard CSS maintenace can be once your project matures at a certain level.

- **Cross-browser compatible**
> Writing CSS that works in a browser is one thing and writing CSS that works in all browsers is another. If you don't take this thing seriously, it may haunt your dreams once the project acquires a high customer base.
