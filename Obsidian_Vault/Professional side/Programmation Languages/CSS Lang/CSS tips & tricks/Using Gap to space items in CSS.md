- Using Gap to space items
>When building flex or grid layouts, you can easily add spacing between the elements by using the gap property to make sure equal space is placed between your items.

```css
.container {
	display: flex;
	flex-wrap: wrap;
	gap: 1em;
}
```

This is a much better way compared to manually having to add different margin properties to achieve the same result !
