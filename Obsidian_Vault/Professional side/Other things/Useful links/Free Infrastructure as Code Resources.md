Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning of infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration.
  
One popular infrastructure as code (IaC) tool is Terraform.
  
According to Hashicorp, Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share.
  
But in simpler words Terraform allows you to automate and manage your infrastructure, your platform and your services that run on that platform.
