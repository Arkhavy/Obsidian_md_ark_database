5. **Code coverage metrics**

Another important testing concept to understand is code coverage. Code coverage is a testing metric to help assess the test performance and quality of the software, however, it can be a bad metric if you're only writing tests to meet the coverage and not to write relevant test cases for a given unit.

Code coverage is split between 4 main metrics, which are : Function, Statement, Branch & Line coverage.

Code coverage is measured in percentages from 0 to 100.
