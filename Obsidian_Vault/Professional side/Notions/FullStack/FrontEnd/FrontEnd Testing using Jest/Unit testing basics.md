2. **Unit testing basics**

To Write unit tests, we use testing frameworks such as Jest, which is a great & popular choice ! With Jest, we can set up a testing environment and then create test suites with multiple test cases.
  
When writing unit tests, it's important to know what these topics are:

- **Test suite**
> A group of unit tests that are related, for example, all the tests for a specific component or method.

- **Unit test**
> The actual test that we write for our unit, complete with a relevant description and the test code.

- **Test assertion**
> Assertions are expectations that we have about our code, for example, we could exepct a value to be truthy, if assertions are met, the test passes.
