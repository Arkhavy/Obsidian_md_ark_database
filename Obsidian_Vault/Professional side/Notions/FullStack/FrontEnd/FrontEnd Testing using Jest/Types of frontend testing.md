1. **Types of Frontend testing**

Fronted testing can be easily divided into three major categories: **E2E** *(End to end)* testing, **Integration** testing and **Unit** testing.  

- **E2E Testing**
> Testing that the app performs as intended from start to finish by using real world flows. This includes testing component communication and API calls.

- **Integration testing**
> Usually means testing the communication between the UI and APIs it communicates with to ensure integration.

_ **Unit testing**
> The most common and easiest to implement, used for testing isolated parts of the code as units. A unit can be a method, component, action, etc.
