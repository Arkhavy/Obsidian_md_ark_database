### Master frontend Testing : A complete guide using jest

- **Introduction**

Writing tests is one of the hardest things that a developer has to do.

Writing frontend tests is even harder, but it is necessary, it allows us to detect bugs early on before they reach our users, and to build a stable, reliable codebase.

If you're willingly avoiding frontend testing, it's time to stop, it will not help you in the long run and it brings no benefits to the applications you're working on.

In this post, we will go through a testing journey and get familiar with testing types, concepts and even write a few test cases for a React application using Jest & Enzyme.
