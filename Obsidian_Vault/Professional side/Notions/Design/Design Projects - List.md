#Design 

To get a job, you need to stand out to employers and as a designer, your portfolio and projects you include there can help you with that.

- **ECommerce Website**
>An ECommerce Website Design is a must for most jobs, especially for ECommerce jobs, because companies like to see you know their business challenges and how you are able to solve them.

- **Mobile App Design** 
>Make sure you include at least one app design in your portfolio. You should show you are comfortable working with both Android and ios design kits.

- **Landing Page**
>Simple but effective, a landing page might sound simple but remember that the goal of a landing page is to get a potential user. This is done by converting visitors into signups. So when designing a landing page, the purpose is to grab the user's attention.
