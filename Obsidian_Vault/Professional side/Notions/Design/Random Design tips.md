#Design

Pick a color palette
Use the 60/30/10 rule
	60% for primary
	30% for secondary
	10% for accents

Images with empty space can host some text and functions

Respect type hierarchy : don't put titles everywhere

Drop shadows
	X 0
	Y 50
	Blur 100
	Alpha 10%
Ambient shadow
	Duplicate the layer
	Add a blur effect
	Decrease opacity
Dark surface shadow
	Add shadows to elements over dark background

Let your layout breathe
	Leave some space between text, images, buttons and everything

Contrast can help deal with lisibility

Iconography is important, don't overcomplicate things
Everything should be consistent in style and size
