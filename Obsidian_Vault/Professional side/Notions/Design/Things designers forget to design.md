#Design 

When designing complex digital products, we can forget about some things that, despite appearances, bring a lot of positive experiences for users.

- **Default user avatar** 
>Many users do not change the default settings in their applications. Therefore, it is up to you what your users will have a default avatar.

- **Favicon** 
>It's a small icon displayed on browser tabs, search results, or bookmarks lists. For Favicon, we usually use the logo of a given brand to increase its users' awareness.

- **404 Error Page** 
>A 404 error is a message that indicates that your browser has connected to the page server, but cannot find the content because the request refers to a location or file that does not exist.

- **App store images** 
>App store images present the most important functions of the application. As a result, they become a powerful marketing tool that can convince a new user to download the application.

- **Welcome e-mail** 
>Emails designed in a good and innovative way can present your brand well and convey the benefits of registration. It will keep new users positive about your brand.

- **The loading state** 
>Sometimes the application needs a moment to load new content after sliding the content for a long time with your finger. It's the perfect moment to present a loader that will indicate that the content is loading.
