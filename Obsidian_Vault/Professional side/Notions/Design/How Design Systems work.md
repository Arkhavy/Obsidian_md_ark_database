How Design Systems work

A Design System is a collection of reusable design patterns, guided by clear standards, to build products at scale.
In 2013, Brad Frost introduced the concept of Atomic Design.
Design Systems are based on this approach.
Token -> atom -> molecule -> organism -> template -> page

Imagine a set of nested russian dolls
**Token**: Cannot be broken down further, such as colors or icons.
**Atom**: Smallest graphic brick like label, input or button.
**Molecule**: Group of bonded atoms.
**Organism**: Group of molecules forming a distinct part of an interface.
**Template**: Group of organisms stitched to form a page.
**Page**: Specific instance of templates.

Breaking down the features into very small pieces makes it easier:
> To reuse
> To standardize.
> To recombine them differently.

But a design system is not only a big box of UI lego pieces.
The difference lies in what surrounds these legos

1. Clear standards
They define the identity of the product and the global user experience.
General principles liek branding but also tone of voice, language, and other visual and interaction design guidelines.

2. Documentation
It consolidates usage guidelines to help the team ship predictable UIs.
Documentation is crucial to the adoption, as it explains how to use components and defines their purpose and behavior for both designers and developers.

3. Support
Because a design system is only as effective as the team that supports it.
It requires ongoing maintenance and monitoring, as well as constant feedback from its users.
