To build a website or a software, how many colors do you think you need ?
5 ? As the most popular color palette generators seem to suggest ?
You need **more** colors than you think !

To make sure you have all the colors you need, start with grayscales to estimate :

- **List the color categories**:
**Grey** : At least 8-10 shades for fonts, backgrounds, dividers, etc.
**Primary & accent** : 5-10 for each.
**States** : Count 5-10 more for alerts, sucesses and errors.

- **Choose the base colors**:
Then pick the darkest and lightest shade. Don't hesitate to make a simulation with a real component like the alert.

- **Once you've got your base, darkest, and lightest shades, fill in between !**
For most projects, you'll need at least 5 shades per color, and probably closer to 10 if you don't want to feel too limited.

- **Last quick tips**:
As tempting as it may be, you can't rely on math alone to create the perfect color palette. Your eye is a much better trained judge.

To choose your shades, start with a color that matches the hue of your base color, then adjust the saturation and brightness until you are satisfied.
