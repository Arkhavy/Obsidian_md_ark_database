### **What is wireframing ?**

Designing a website service at the structural level is wireframing. It provides a clear overview of the page structure, layout, information architecture, userflow, functionality, and intended behaviors.

- **Purpose of wireframing**:
> Keep the concept user-focused.
> Clarify and define website features.
> Quick and cheap to create.

- **Types of wireframe**:

1. Low-fidelity wireframes
> Low-fidelity wireframes are basic visual represnetations of the webpage and usually serve as the design's starting point. As such, they tend to be fairly rough, created without any sense of scale, grid, or pixel-accuracy.

2. Mid-fidelity wireframes
> Mid-fidelity wireframes feature more accurate represnetations of the layout. They avoid distractions such as images or typography. more details is assigned to specific components, and features are clearly differentiated from each other.

3. High-fidelity wireframes
> High-fidelity wireframes boast pixel-specific layouts. They may include actual featured images and relevant written content. This makes them ideal for exploring and documenting complex concepts such as menu systems or interactive maps.
